# Reddit client
This React web application uses the Reddit API to allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.\
This project was built to practice working with **React**, **React router** and **Redux**.
This project was also built using **Angular** [here](https://github.com/makarovangelika/reddit-client-angular).
## Usage
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This project was deployed using Netlify [here](https://client-reddit.netlify.app/).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

When the users click on the link of the subreddit in the post or in the menu they can see the list of subreddit's posts.\
When the users click on the post in the list they are navigated to the separate route for an individual post. On this page they can see the post and the comments which are displayed with nested replies.
